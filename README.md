The Instagram-like comment section is a feature in a web application that allows users to post comments on various content items, such as images or posts. It replicates the commenting functionality found on Instagram's posts and provides a platform for users to engage, share their thoughts, and interact with each other through comments.

Description of the Instagram-like comment section:

Comment Input Box: The comment section begins with an input box where users can type their comments. The input box is typically placed below the content item, such as an image or post, along with an avatar or profile picture of the user who is currently logged in.

Comment Display Area: Below the input box, there is a display area that shows the existing comments posted by users. Each comment is usually represented with the user's avatar or profile picture, the user's username, the comment content, and the timestamp indicating when the comment was posted.

Like and Dislike: Similar to Instagram, each comment may have a "Like" and "Dislike" option represented by heart and thumb-down icons, respectively. Users can click on the "Like" icon to express their appreciation for a comment or click on the "Dislike" icon to show their disagreement.

Like/Dislike Counts: The number of likes and dislikes for each comment is displayed next to the corresponding icons. This count dynamically updates as users like or dislike a comment.

Comment Actions: Users can interact with the comments through various actions:

Reply: Users can reply to a specific comment, creating a nested or threaded comment under the original one.
Edit/Delete: If allowed, users can edit or delete their own comments within a certain time frame after posting.
Pagination: To manage a large number of comments, the comment section may implement pagination, allowing users to view a certain number of comments per page. Users can navigate between pages to see more comments.

User Interaction Restrictions: As per Instagram-like functionality, certain restrictions apply to user interactions:

Users cannot like or dislike their own comments.
Users cannot like or dislike the same comment multiple times.
Users may have a limit on the number of comments they can post per content item.
Smooth Loading: The comment section should provide a smooth user experience by loading comments and new interactions dynamically without the need to refresh the page.

Real-Time Updates: For a more engaging experience, some implementations may include real-time updates, showing new comments as they are posted by other users.
